This is implementation of a blockchain using Python and Flask.

It explains concepts behind blockchain technology such as:
- Blocks and block hashing
- Proof of Work (mining)
- Transactions
- Chain validation
- Immutability

## Project Structure
- `block.py` – Defines the structure of a block and hashing logic
- `blockchain.py` – Handles blockchain logic, mining, and validation
- `app.py` – Flask API to interact with the blockchain
